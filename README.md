## Comment
Below You can find tasks status. Beside working on the tasks I have added notebooks which I used to learn about the data and understand it better.

### TASK1 - organizational instructions
That is done. I was trying to work on each branch/task separately. Finished task was merged to master using PR. Multiple commits where squashed.
 
### TASK2 - sense of humour
I really like that one. Within docs there is jokes.md file with my favourite meme. 

### TASK3 - good practices
That is done. I only lacked of the initial assumptions and I made my own decisions. What I did not add is logging and error handling. 

### TASK4 - feature engineering
That is done. Within docs there is .md file where I describe chosen feature engineering approach.

### TASK5 - models
In progress.  

### TASK6 - measures
In progress.  

### TASK7 - docker
In progress.  

### TASK8 - tests
TO DO. 

### TASK9 - prediction api
In progress.  

## Well planned challenge!!!
